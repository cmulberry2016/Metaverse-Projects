## **The Problem**
   
Spatial understanding of core features within AR HMD applications

## **The Challenge**

How to track knowledge retention within a simulated environment 

## The Solution

System Stack Used:

- Input with **[Messages API](https://docs.enklu.com/docs/API/Messages)**
- Interfacing through **[Hands API](https://docs.enklu.com/docs/API/Hand)** and **[Spatial Artificial Intelligence API](https://docs.enklu.com/docs/API/App#sai-object)**
- Training with **[Spatial Artificial Intelligence](https://docs.enklu.com/docs/API/App#sai-object)**
- Scripted in **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**

## **The Results**

- Sequence Completion Rate > 70%

## The Opportunity

How can artificial intelligence assistants be used to help users navigate through AR HMD tools?

## **The Problem**
   
Understanding how complex implicit system relationships are configured are difficult to understand without breaking down to individual components.

## **The Challenge**

Disassembling meshed prefabs from industrial design files and adding tween movement animations + descriptions interface windows.

## The Solution

System Stack Used:

- Input with [X]
- Interfacing with [Y]
- Inferencing through **[CoreML Model](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/)**
- Training with **[Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/#overview)**
- Programming Languages: **[C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/)**,  **[C#](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**, **[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)**
- Hardware: Hololens 2

## **The Results**

Comprehension Rate: 80%

## The Opportunity

How can AR HMD operating systems be used to search real-world objects in the real world environment?
